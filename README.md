HDDcoin is an eco-friendly blockchain that supports digital money, global payments and applications.

We use the Proof of Space Time consensus pioneered by Chiaâ„¢, and the powerful and secure Chialisp language for Smart Contracts.

HDDcoin is not affiliated with Chia Network, Inc., but uses their open-sourced software as its foundation.

Securing the blockchain via Proof of Space Time is called farming, and instead of using specialized equipment that uses huge amounts of energy for Proof of Work consensus, the amount of storage on your Hard Disk Drives allocated to HDDcoin secures the Network.

If the client does not find any connections automatically, you can add one of the following:

-	node-1.hddcoin.org Port 28444
-	node-2.hddcoin.org Port 28444
-	node-3.hddcoin.org Port 28444
-	node-4.hddcoin.org Port 28444
